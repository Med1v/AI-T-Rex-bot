# AI-T-Rex-bot

## Why so messy? 
Used this project to learn about Tensor Flow and Machine Learning.
This is my first AI project ever.
Surprisingly for me it worked pretty well.

## Version 1 without view shifting
Learned by itself by looking into records of me playing. Record score was 3k but on avarage it went to about 2k.

## Version with view shifting
By ~~cheating~~ hardcoding increase of speed overtime by shifting view of the bot to the right. That makes him jump earlier even without understanding what is ~~time~~ speed.
It's record score was 17,715. Probably with better adjustments it's possible to beat the record but that record run took 1004 second (or 16.7 minutes) and I'm bored of waiting even more.

## Help
If you're interested in how to lounch this bot on your PC messege me. I'll help.

## Reference
I used this implementation of T-Rex game: [T-Rex](http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/). Because I'm not crazy to turn off my internet. I don't wanna ~~die~~ suffer.
